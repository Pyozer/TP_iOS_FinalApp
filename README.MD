# Final iOS App project

This app is a school project, the last of iOS learning module.
App made with Xcode and Swift 4.2.

The goal is to made an app with a Login, Register and Profil screen.

Some design pattern has been implemented, like Delegate and Singleton.

Bonus done:
- Email format validation
- Password length, minimum 6 characters
- Display error messages under textfields
- Display Alert when login success
- Add calculator easter egg (on press "Go to register" and seconds is after 50, ex between: 16h23:50 and 16h23:59)

During this project I also made a (Snake Game)[https://github.com/Pyozer/Swift-Snake-Game] (also in Swift).
When you press "Play button" on ProfilView, the game is open (if it is already installed).
